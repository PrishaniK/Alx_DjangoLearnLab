# Permissions and Groups Setup â€” Django Library App

This guide explains how custom permissions and user groups are implemented in the `bookshelf` app of the Django project.

---

## Custom Permissions

Custom permissions are defined for the `Book` model to control access to various actions.

### Defined Permissions:

- `can_view` â€“ View books
- `can_create` â€“ Add new books
- `can_edit` â€“ Edit existing books
- `can_delete` â€“ Delete books

These permissions are declared in `bookshelf/models.py`:

```python
class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    publication_year = models.PositiveIntegerField()

    class Meta:
        permissions = [
            ("can_view", "Can view book"),
            ("can_create", "Can create book"),
            ("can_edit", "Can edit book"),
            ("can_delete", "Can delete book"),
        ]
Groups Setup
User groups are created and assigned permissions using a custom Django management command.

Groups:
Viewers â€“ can_view

Editors â€“ can_view, can_create, can_edit

Admins â€“ all permissions (can_view, can_create, can_edit, can_delete)

Run Command:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py setup_groups
This script is defined in:

bash
Copy code
bookshelf/management/commands/setup_groups.py
After running the command, use the Django Admin panel to assign users to the appropriate groups.

View Permissions
Each view that interacts with the Book model is protected using @permission_required.

Example:
python
Copy code
@permission_required('bookshelf.can_edit', raise_exception=True)
def edit_book(request, pk):
    ...
Protected Views:
View Function	Required Permission
list_books	bookshelf.can_view
create_book	bookshelf.can_create
edit_book	bookshelf.can_edit
delete_book	bookshelf.can_delete

File Overview
File Path	Description
bookshelf/models.py	Custom permissions added to Book model
bookshelf/views.py	Views protected using permission decorators
bookshelf/forms.py	BookForm used in create/edit views
bookshelf/management/commands/setup_groups.py	Script to create user groups and assign permissions
README.md	Documentation of permission & group setup

ðŸš€ Deployment
Once all files are updated, commit and push your changes:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Implement custom permissions and group-based access control"
git push


## Security Enhancements

### Django Settings (settings.py)

| Setting | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `DEBUG = False` | Disables debug mode in production |
| `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True` | Enables XSS filter in modern browsers |
| `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True` | Prevents MIME-sniffing |
| `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'` | Prevents clickjacking |
| `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True` | Sends CSRF cookies over HTTPS only |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` | Sends session cookies over HTTPS only |
| `CSP_*` | Enforces Content Security Policy via `django-csp` |

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

We used [`django-csp`](https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp) to add a Content Security Policy:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS += ['csp']
MIDDLEWARE = ['csp.middleware.CSPMiddleware', ...]
Example CSP settings:

python
Copy code
CSP_DEFAULT_SRC = ("'self'",)
CSP_SCRIPT_SRC = ("'self'",)
CSP_STYLE_SRC = ("'self'", 'https://fonts.googleapis.com')
CSP_FONT_SRC = ("'self'", 'https://fonts.gstatic.com')
CSP_IMG_SRC = ("'self'", 'data:')
2. Manual Security Testing Checklist
Hereâ€™s how to test the protections youâ€™ve added:

CSRF Protection
Go to a form (e.g. create/edit book)

View page source â€” you should see:
<input type="hidden" name="csrfmiddlewaretoken" ... >

Try submitting the form without the CSRF token â†’ it should throw an error.

XSS Protection
Try entering a <script> tag in a form field

It should not execute when displayed â€” it should be escaped.

SQL Injection Protection
If you have any form input that filters/searches DB records:

Try input like: 1' OR 1=1 -- or '; DROP TABLE

Should not break the app

Django ORM automatically prevents these unless you write raw SQL

CSP Header Check
Open browser dev tools â†’ Network tab â†’ click on any request â†’ go to Headers

You should see:

css
Copy code
content-security-policy: default-src 'self'; ...
